# odin-recipes

Day 1:
I will make this file have a few images (with alt info), a few lists (both ordered and unordered), and different font sizes and headings.

I believe this is going to contain recipes based on the name, but I'll find out and come back to reflect after this is finished. I enjoy this coding aspect and it definitely hurts that I have to start from this point again (I've done HTML/CSS foundations 3 times now this makes) but I need to make sure that I can do everything. This is a muscle I have not trained in so long.

Day 2:
