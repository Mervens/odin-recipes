# odin-recipes

Day 1:
I will make this file have a few images (with alt info), a few lists (both ordered and unordered), and different font sizes and headings.

I believe this is going to contain recipes based on the name, but I'll find out and come back to reflect after this is finished. I enjoy this coding aspect and it definitely hurts that I have to start from this point again (I've done HTML/CSS foundations 3 times now this makes) but I need to make sure that I can do everything. This is a muscle I have not trained in so long.

Day 2:

Day 5: Back to this! Been a bit busy at work but I'm currently 57% through fundamentals and it's time apparently to go and fix up this site using the CSS taught so far. CSS was generally my favorite part of the designing process, so I'm exited to see how I can evolve this initial plain-white site.
