    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Water</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Flour</li>
        <li>6 teaspoons Sugar (White preferred)</li>
        <li>1/3 tablespoon Button (or Margarine)</li>
        <li>1 package Instant Chocolate Pudding Mix</li>
        <li>3 cups Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>1 ounce Cognac</li>
        <li>1 ounce Bittersweet Chocolate</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups Confectioners' Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Directions
        <li>Crepe batter: In a large bowl, mix together eggs, milk, water, flour, sugar, 1 teaspoon butter, and cognac.
        </li>
        <li>Filling: Beat pudding mix, and whipping cream together with an electric mixer until the mixture is thick.
        </li>
        <li>Sauce: in a small saucepan, melt the chocolate, butter, evaporated milk, and confectioners' sugar together
            until the mixture is a little thick.</li>
        <li>Crepes: heat a small skillet (or crepe pan) to a high temperature. Place a small amount of batter into the
            skillet and swirl it around until the batter covers the bottom of the pan. When the crepe is slightly
            browned flip the crepe over and let the other side brown for a few seconds. The first crepe will most likely
            not turn out well, but the rest will. Stack the crepes on top of each other to let tem cool before filling.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon the filling into the center of each crepe and roll the crepe up around it. Spoon the sauce over the
            crepes and serve.</li>
    </ol>
