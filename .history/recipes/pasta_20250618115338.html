    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Seafood dish of warm shrimp cooked in butter, garlic, and white wine. Multiple different versions of this dish
        but today we will serve it over delicious pasta.</p>
    <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <li>16 ounce package Linguine Pasta
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Extra-Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>2 Shallots (Finely diced)
        </li>
        <li>2 cloves Garlic (Minced)</li>
        <li>1 pound Shrimp (Peeled and deveined)</li>
        <li>1 pinch Kosher Salt and freshly Ground Pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup dry White Wine</li>
        <li>1 Lemon (Juiced)</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh Parsley Leaves (Finely chopped)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Time: 20 mins Prep - 20 mins Cook</p>
    <ol><strong>Directions</strong>
        <li>Crepe batter: In a large bowl, mix together eggs, milk, water, flour, sugar, 1 teaspoon butter, and
            cognac.
        </li>
        <li>Filling: Beat pudding mix, and whipping cream together with an electric mixer until the mixture is
            thick.
        </li>
        <li>Sauce: in a small saucepan, melt the chocolate, butter, evaporated milk, and confectioners' sugar
            together
            until the mixture is a little thick.</li>
        <li>Crepes: heat a small skillet (or crepe pan) to a high temperature. Place a small amount of batter into
            the
            skillet and swirl it around until the batter covers the bottom of the pan. When the crepe is slightly
            browned flip the crepe over and let the other side brown for a few seconds. The first crepe will most
            likely
            not turn out well, but the rest will. Stack the crepes on top of each other to let tem cool before
            filling.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon the filling into the center of each crepe and roll the crepe up around it. Spoon the sauce over
            the
            crepes and serve.</li>
    </ol>
