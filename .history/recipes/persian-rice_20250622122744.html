        </p><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
    <ol class="directions">
        <li>Place water and kosher salt in a pot; bring to a boil. Add rice; cook and stir for exactly 7 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cover bottom of the pot with 1 layer of potato slices.
            Sprinkle cumin and salt over potatoes. Cook until potatoes are sizzling, 2 to 3 minutes; top potatoes with
            rice to form an even layer. Reduce heat to low and place butter slices over rice.
        </li>
        <li>Top the pot with a layer of clean paper towels, then place the lid over the towels. Steam until rice is
            fluffy, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Grind saffron threads with a mortar and pestle. Mix crushed saffron with 1 ½ tablespoons hot water in a
            large bowl. Add a couple of spoonfuls of rice to saffron mixture and stir until rice is yellow.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon remaining rice into a serving bowl. Top with saffron rice and line the edges of the bowl with
            potatoes. Garnish with parsley.</li>
