    <p>Spicy seasoned rice surrounded by golden potatoes and enriched with saffron, this rice goes perfect in so many
        combinations allowing for a variety of main dishes.</p>
    <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <li>3 quarts Water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>2 cups Basmati Rice (Rinsed)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 russet Potato (Cut into ¼-inch slices)</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground Cumin</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Butter (Thinly Sliced)</li>
        <li>1 pinch Saffron Threads</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped Parsley</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons hot Water</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Time: 15 mins Prep - 55 mins Cook</p>
    <ol><strong>Directions</strong>
        <li>Place water and kosher salt in a pot; bring to a boil. Add rice; cook and stir for exactly 7 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cover bottom of the pot with 1 layer of potato slices.
            Sprinkle cumin and salt over potatoes. Cook until potatoes are sizzling, 2 to 3 minutes; top potatoes with
            rice to form an even layer. Reduce heat to low and place butter slices over rice.
        </li>
        <li>Top the pot with a layer of clean paper towels, then place the lid over the towels. Steam until rice is
            fluffy, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Grind saffron threads with a mortar and pestle. Mix crushed saffron with 1 ½ tablespoons hot water in a
            large bowl. Add a couple of spoonfuls of rice to saffron mixture and stir until rice is yellow.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon remaining rice into a serving bowl. Top with saffron rice and line the edges of the bowl with
            potatoes. Garnish with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
