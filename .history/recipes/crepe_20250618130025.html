    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Decadent soft dish made from batter, a crepe is a classic originating from France with light texture and a
        variety of flavors. There are a multitude of creation ideas and combinations for the Crepe, so in this
        recipe we
        will be focusing on a chocolate crepe.</p>
    <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Water</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Flour</li>
        <li>6 teaspoons Sugar (White preferred)</li>
        <li>1/3 tablespoon Button (or Margarine)</li>
        <li>1 package Instant Chocolate Pudding Mix</li>
        <li>3 cups Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>1 ounce Cognac</li>
        <li>1 ounce Bittersweet Chocolate</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups Confectioners' Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Time: 20 mins Prep - 20 mins Cook</p>
    <ol><strong>Directions</strong>
        <li>Crepe batter: In a large bowl, mix together eggs, milk, water, flour, sugar, 1 teaspoon butter, and
            cognac.
        </li>
        <li>Filling: Beat pudding mix, and whipping cream together with an electric mixer until the mixture is
            thick.
        </li>
        <li>Sauce: in a small saucepan, melt the chocolate, butter, evaporated milk, and confectioners' sugar
            together
            until the mixture is a little thick.</li>
        <li>Crepes: heat a small skillet (or crepe pan) to a high temperature. Place a small amount of batter into
            the
            skillet and swirl it around until the batter covers the bottom of the pan. When the crepe is slightly
            browned flip the crepe over and let the other side brown for a few seconds. The first crepe will most
            likely
            not turn out well, but the rest will. Stack the crepes on top of each other to let tem cool before
            filling.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon the filling into the center of each crepe and roll the crepe up around it. Spoon the sauce over
            the
            crepes and serve.</li>
    </ol>
